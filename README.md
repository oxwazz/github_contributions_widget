## FAQ

**1. why is my widget not updating, causing my latest contributions not to be listed?**

> GitHub has image caching by default, this causing your latest contributions not reflect on this widget.
> to solve this issue you can manually update the image using query params like `?refresh-cache=1`
> or you can update `?refresh-cache=` automatically using GitHub Action cronjob
> with [probablykasper/readme-template-action](https://github.com/probablykasper/readme-template-action),
> you can [see the example](https://github.com/oxwazz/oxwazz) in my repository.

**2. can we use a widget theme based on the browser's light or dark mode?**

>
Yes, [GitHub markdown has support for light and dark mode images](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#specifying-the-theme-an-image-is-shown-to).
> You can implement a widget that changes its theme depending on the browser's mode using the <picture> element.
> ```markdown
> <picture>
>   <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://github-contributions-widget.oxwazz.com/oxwazz?theme=dark">
>   <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://github-contributions-widget.oxwazz.com/oxwazz">
>   <img alt="show widget theme based on browser light or dark mode." src="https://github-contributions-widget.oxwazz.com/oxwazz">
> </picture>
> ```

## Why

## Limitation

üìê This code is deployed on a [Cloudflare worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/rust/). As we are
utilizing the free tier, there
are [certain limitations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#worker-limits)
associated with it. Additionally, it interacts with
the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/about-the-graphql-api),
which also
has [usage limits](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/rate-limits-and-node-limits-for-the-graphql-api#node-limit)
in place.
