## :thread: How it works

🕯This code is deployed on [Cloudflare worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/rust/). The main
entry
script is lib.rs. It makes a request to the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer),
and create svg based on the responses.

## :wrench: Tools

1. https://yqnn.github.io/svg-path-editor - create svg path
